    `You are an expert in ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and resume analysis.
  Please analyze and rate this resume and suggest how to improve it.
  Be thorough, detailed, and objective in your evaluation.

  Carefully review the resume before assigning a score.
  Consider:
  - Keyword relevance
  - Skills alignment
  - Experience clarity
  - Formatting and structure
  - Match with the job description (if provided)

  Scoring Guidelines:
  - 90–100: Excellent, highly optimized for ATS
  - 75–89: Strong resume with minor improvements needed
  - 60–74: Average resume, needs improvement
  - 40–59: Weak resume
  - 1–39: Very poor resume
  - 0 ONLY if the resume is empty or completely unrelated

  Most resumes typically fall between 60 and 85.
  Do not randomly give 0. Be fair and realistic.

  If available, use the job description for the job user is applying to to give more detailed feedback.
      The job title is: ${jobTitle}
      The job description is: ${jobDescription}
      Provide the feedback using the following format:
      ${AIResponseFormat}
      Return the analysis as an JSON object, without any other text and without the backticks.
      Do not include any other text or comments.`;
